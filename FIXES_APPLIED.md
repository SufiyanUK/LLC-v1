# Fixes Applied

## Issue 1: Default Count = 0 Not Allowed ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Setting default count to 0 gave an error "Failed to set default count"

**Root Cause:** API validation was set to `ge=1` (greater than or equal to 1)

**Fix:** Changed to `ge=0` to allow 0 as a valid value

**File:** `api_v2.py` line 947
```python
# Before:
default_count: int = Query(..., ge=1, le=100)

# After:
default_count: int = Query(..., ge=0, le=100)
```

**Behavior:**
- Default = 0: Auto-refetch is DISABLED (manual management only)
- Default > 0: Auto-refetch maintains that count automatically

**User Feedback:** When you set default to 0, you'll see:
"Auto-refetch disabled for {company} (default = 0)"

## Issue 2: Warning Message on Company Selection ✅ REMOVED

**Problem:** When selecting a company to add employees, a warning appeared:
"⚠️ Already tracking 4 employees"

**User Request:** Remove this warning as it's unnecessary

**Fix:** Removed the API call and warning display logic

**File:** `index_v3.html` lines 942-960 (removed)

**Before:**
- Selected company → API check → Display warning if already tracking
- Warning shown in company box

**After:**
- Selected company → No API check → No warning
- Clean selection without unnecessary alerts

## Summary

Both issues have been resolved:

1. ✅ You can now set default count to 0 (disables auto-refetch)
2. ✅ No more warning messages when selecting companies

## How to Test

### Test Default = 0:
1. Select a company (e.g., "openai")
2. Set **Default** field to `0`
3. You should see: "Auto-refetch disabled for openai (default = 0)"
4. Delete an employee from that company
5. Verify: No auto-refetch happens (count decreases and stays decreased)

### Test Default > 0:
1. Select another company (e.g., "anthropic")
2. Set **Default** field to `5`
3. Delete an employee (if count was 5, it goes to 4)
4. Verify: System auto-fetches 1 employee to restore count to 5

### Test No Warnings:
1. Select any company that already has tracked employees
2. Enter a number in the "Add:" field
3. Verify: No warning message appears

## Restart Required

After these fixes, restart your API server:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
python api_v2.py
```

Then refresh your browser: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
