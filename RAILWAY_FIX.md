# Railway Deployment Fix - FINAL SOLUTION

## What Was Wrong
- Railway was confused by duplicate files in root and employee_tracker directories
- The `root` directive in railway.json wasn't working properly
- Import paths were breaking

## The Fix
Created a clean entry point architecture:

1. **main.py** (root level) - Entry point that imports from employee_tracker
2. **__init__.py** files - Make directories proper Python packages
3. **Updated railway.json** - Uses main:app instead of complex paths
4. **Updated Procfile** - Points to main:app

## File Structure Now
```
/ (root)
├── main.py                  # NEW: Entry point for Railway
├── railway.json             # UPDATED: Uses main:app
├── Procfile                 # UPDATED: Uses main:app
├── requirements.txt         # Dependencies
└── employee_tracker/
    ├── __init__.py          # NEW: Makes it a package
    ├── api_v2.py           # The actual API
    ├── config/
    │   ├── __init__.py      # NEW: Makes it a package
    │   └── target_companies.py
    └── scripts/
        ├── __init__.py      # NEW: Makes it a package
        ├── database.py
        ├── employee_tracker.py
        └── ... (other scripts)
```

## Railway Environment Variables Required
```
API_KEY=e6419b40326f0d2a7848b04c2be9ad0b46b868963cb8f4cb4b6764f58c8427ac
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
DATABASE_URL=(auto-provided by Railway PostgreSQL)
```

## How It Works
1. Railway runs `uvicorn main:app`
2. main.py imports the app from employee_tracker/api_v2.py
3. All paths are properly resolved
4. Auto-migration runs on startup if DATABASE_URL exists

## Testing
✅ Tested locally - server starts successfully
✅ All imports work correctly
✅ Health endpoint accessible

This is the definitive fix that should make Railway deployment work!
