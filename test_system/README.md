# Employee Tracker Test System

This test system allows you to verify the departure detection and alert classification logic without using any PDL credits.

## Quick Start

### Windows
Double-click `run_test.bat` or run:
```bash
run_test.bat
```

### Mac/Linux or Python
```bash
python run_test.py
```

Or directly:
```bash
python test_departure_system.py
```

## What Gets Tested

The test system simulates 5 different scenarios:

### 1. **Level 1 Alert - Standard Departure**
- Employee: John Smith
- Scenario: OpenAI ‚Üí Microsoft (big tech to big tech)
- Expected: Yellow alert (Level 1)

### 2. **Level 2 Alert - Building Signals**
- Employee: Sarah Johnson  
- Scenario: Anthropic ‚Üí "Working on something new"
- Expected: Orange alert (Level 2)
- Signals: "building", "something new", "stealth mode"

### 3. **Level 3 Alert - Joined Startup**
- Employee: Michael Chen
- Scenario: Meta ‚Üí NeuralTech AI (CTO & Co-Founder)
- Expected: Red alert (Level 3)
- Company size: 11-50 employees

### 4. **Level 3 Alert - Stealth Mode**
- Employee: Emily Rodriguez
- Scenario: Google ‚Üí CEO (no company name)
- Expected: Red alert (Level 3)
- Signals: "Building in stealth"

### 5. **No Alert - Still Employed**
- Employee: David Kim
- Scenario: Stays at DeepMind
- Expected: No departure detected

## Test Flow

1. **Initial Tracking**: Simulates tracking 5 employees
2. **Departure Check**: Checks for departures after 1 month
3. **Alert Classification**: Classifies departures using production logic
4. **Email Simulation**: Shows what emails would be sent
5. **Validation**: Verifies results match expected outcomes

## Understanding Results

The test will show:
- ‚úÖ **PASSED**: Classification matches expected level
- ‚ùå **FAILED**: Classification doesn't match expected level

Example output:
```
üî¥ LEVEL 3 - STARTUP/FOUNDER (2 alerts)
  ‚Ä¢ Michael Chen
